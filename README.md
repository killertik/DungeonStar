# DungeonStar

**A classic "Dungeons and Dragons"-inspired adventure game built with Python 3 as a project for a Coursera programming class.**

Embark on a thrilling journey as a fearless adventurer exploring a perilous cave system! Battle fearsome monsters, discover valuable items (weapons), and navigate a dangerous world in this text-based role-playing game.

This project was developed as part of a Python 3 programming course on Coursera, with a strong emphasis on object-oriented principles. The codebase utilizes Classes and Inheritance to structure the game's entities and logic.

* Classic dungeon crawler.
* Object-oriented design.
* Dungeon-style narrative where the user embodies the brave adventurer.
* Encounters with various monsters to test your "skills".
* ASCII monster art
* Interactive text game
  

**Current Status & Future Development:**

While the game is playable, it is only a base for future developments. There are still areas for improvement and potential bugs lurking within the depths of the code. 
Despite an initial attempt at debugging with the assistance of Large Language Models, further refinement and testing are required.
